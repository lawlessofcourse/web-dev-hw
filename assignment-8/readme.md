# Intro-Web-Dev Assignment #8 BOXES
## Jack Lawless

* Padding controls the spacing inside the box, so if you added 20px of padding the box would expand 20px but the content stays the same. Margins controls the space between boxes, and border is the outline of that box and the appearance of it can be changed.
* The hardest part of this task was creating a layout and getting my fonts to work. I'm not sure if my fonts are actually link or whether they are appearing correct because they are downloaded on my system.
* For this work cycle I went through the book and web. From there I gathered my materials and got to work. I wasn't totally sure how to lay it out at first but after working awhile I figured it out. Now that im at the end I would actually like to change my whole layout and approach it differently. I have a lot of repeating lines in my CSS document and a lot of absolute positioning which I think can be avoided but would require me to rewrite the index and style sheets.
