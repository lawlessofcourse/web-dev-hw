        <h2>KEEP FLOORS CLEANER</h2>
        <p>You'll LOVE this new kind of vacuum! MUCH less noise.
          MUCH easier to use. Powerful suction that quickly reaches tramped-in dirt...
          makes rugs and floors cleaner and safer from children to use as their playground.</p>

        <h2>ATTACHMENT HOLDER OPTIONAL</h2>
        <p>My FILTER QUEEN cleans from floor to ceiling, too! Marvelous, easy-to-get-on-and-off attachments.
          Dusts floors and furniture. Sprays wax, shampoos rugs, controls moths. Even dries hair and filers room air!
          And still more attachments for cleaning upholstery, drapes, blinks and moldings! What a vacuum!</p>
