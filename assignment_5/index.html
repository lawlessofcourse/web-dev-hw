      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <p>
      <pre>
Come out come out
No use in hiding
Come now come now
Can you not see?
There's no place here
What were you expecting?
No room for both
Just room for me

So you will lay your arms down
Yes I will call this home

Away away
You have been banished
Your land is gone
And given to me
And here I will spread my wings
Yes I will call this home

What's this you say
You feel a right to remain
Then stay and I will bury you
What's this you say
Your father's spirit still lives in this place
I will silence you

Here's the hitch
Your horse is leaving
Don't miss your boat
It's leaving now

And as you go I will spread my wings
Yes I will call this home
I have no time to justify to you
Fool you're blind, move aside for me
All I can say to you my new neighbor
Is you must move on or I will bury you

And this land is your land
This land is my land
From California to the New York islands
From the Rain Wood Forest to the Golf stream waters
This land was made

I'll build heaven and call it home
I live with my justice
I live with my greedy need
I live with no mercy
I live with my frenzied feeding
I live with my hatred
I live with my jealousy
I live with the notion
That I don't need anyone but me

Don't drink the water
Don't drink the water
There's blood in the water
Don't drink the water
Don't drink the water
There's blood in the water
Don't drink the water
