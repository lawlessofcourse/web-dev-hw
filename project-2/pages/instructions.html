  <h3>Quick Tip</h3>
    <p>
      Sacrifice a stiffer board because it will be more rigid for touring and
      once split, it will ride quite a bit softer.
    </p>
      <br />
    <p>
      If you don't have a lot of the necessary materials and they cost to much,
      remeber to check your local shop and see if they can split the board for you.

  <h3 id="1">1. Slice </h3>
  <img src="../images/split2.jpg" alt="image of board being cut" title="Slice" >
    <p>
      Mark the centerline on the base with a flexible straight edge and a marker-for a smoother slice,
      cut small notches in the tip and tail with a hack saw. Now, clamp the board with the base up and cut it
      from tip to tail with the circular saw. Sand and file the exposed core ’til smooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apply a seal on the exposed edges with a flexible epoxy to keep water out and
      reinforce the edge. (Epoxy from your local shop works best, but you can also use
      marine epoxy, varnish, Varathane, or enamel paint.) Let the edges completely dry
      before moving on.
    </p>

  <h3 id="2"> 2. Hooks</h3>
    <img src="../images/split3.jpg" alt="" >
    <p>
      Follow the Voile instructions for placing the hook templates on the board.
      Note that contact points on alternative camber boards are a little ambiguous,
      but you can still place them a couple inches in from where the tips flatten out
      (roughly one inch in from the contact points). Mark the holes with the center punch
      and drill them with the 3/16-inch bit. Flip the board over and countersink the base
      holes so the screw heads are flush, then mount the hooks with the supplied screws
      and nuts.
    </p>

  <h3 id="3">3. Bracket And Climbing Bar</h3>
  <img src="../images/split4.jpg" alt="" >
    <p>
      Find the board’s center balance point and place the templates for the touring
      brackets just ahead of this mark. Drill a pilot hole on the top with the1/4-inch
      bit then countersink the T-nuts with the 3/4-inch bit on the base. Tighten the screws
      using blue Locktite. With the climbing block in place set the climbing bar at the block’s end,
      with the bar facing the nose. Drill and mount just like the brackets, but with the 10/32-inch screws and T-nuts.
    </p>

  <h3 id="4">4. Binding Blocks</h3>
    <img src="../images/split5.jpg" alt="" >
    <p>
      Figure out the dimensions of your stance (angles, width, et cetera) and stick the
      binding templates to the board accordingly. Make sure the board is snugged together
      with the hooks and that the stance doesn’t interfere with the touring brackets,
      climbing bars or inserts. Drill holes with the 9/64-inch bit approximately 1/4-inch deep.
      Don’t drill through the board! Make sure the binding block pairs are parallel with
      each other then add epoxy to the holes and screw them down.
    </p>

  <h3 id="5">5. Tip Clip</h3>
    <img src="../images/split6.jpg" alt="" >
    <p>
      Use the template on the tips and drill holes with the 3/16-inch bit. Secure the
      clips with the supplied rivets and flare the ends with the ball-peen hammer or other
      blunt object. Now all you need to do is pick up a set of <abbr title="Strips that attach to the bottom of splitboards for uphill climb">skins</abbr>
      from Voile and you’ll be on your way.

      <h3>Remember!</h3>
      <p>
        Make sure you remeber to use proper saftey equipment and etiquette. Once complete you'll be in the mountains!
        That means you still need proper backcountry equipment, most importantly <abbr title="Avalanche">Avy</abbr> gear!
        Try to find used gear to save some money and dont forget to check out your local stores!
