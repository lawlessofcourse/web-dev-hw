# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Jack Lawless
I decided to take Web Design to advance my career as a student and artist. Last semester I took creative coding and enjoyed the class, this semester I wanted to continue learning computer languages. This class seemed like a great fit, and by the end I'll have the skill to make web pages from scratch.

What is the internet?

* The internet connects users and the web connects information.
* It was interesting to learn where the internet has started and what it has become today. And how all the names come from sea terms.
* I found the videos very informative on understanding the internet and how it works.
